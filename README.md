# Alex Skills

## Skills listing
1. **Eskom load shedding schedule** (South Africa only)

    My first Alex skill! I'm aiming for "Alexa, is there any load shedding today?" or "Alexa, give me a heads up on load shedding."
    or "Alexa, will there be load shedding in Cape Town today?". I'll be looking to source the Eskom data from [this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eskom-loadshedding-api) existing NPM module.
